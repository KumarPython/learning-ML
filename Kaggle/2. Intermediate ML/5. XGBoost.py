# Gradient boosting is a method that goes through cycles to iteratively add models
# into an ensemble.
# It begins by initializing the ensemble with a single model, whose predictions can be
# pretty naive. (Even if its predictions are wildly inaccurate, subsequent additions to
# the ensemble will address those errors.)
# Then, we start the cycle:
# First, we use the current ensemble to generate predictions for each observation in the
# dataset. To make a prediction, we add the predictions from all models in the ensemble.
# These predictions are used to calculate a loss function
# (like mean squared error, for instance). Then, we use the loss function to fit a new model that will be added to the ensemble. Specifically, we determine model parameters so that adding this new model to the ensemble will reduce the loss. (Side note: The "gradient" in "gradient boosting" refers to the fact that we'll use gradient descent on the loss function to determine the parameters in this new model.)
# Finally, we add the new model to ensemble, and ...
# ... repeat!
            from xgboost import XGBRegressor

            my_model = XGBRegressor()
            my_model.fit(X_train, y_train)
            We also make predictions and evaluate the model.

            from sklearn.metrics import mean_absolute_error

            predictions = my_model.predict(X_valid)
            print("Mean Absolute Error: " + str(mean_absolute_error(predictions, y_valid)))

# Parameter Tuning
# XGBoost has a few parameters that can dramatically affect accuracy and training speed.
# The first parameters you should understand are:
# n_estimators
# n_estimators specifies how many times to go through the modeling cycle described above.
# It is equal to the number of models that we include in the ensemble.
# Too low a value causes underfitting, which leads to inaccurate predictions on both
# training data and test data.
# Too high a value causes overfitting, which causes accurate predictions on training data,
# but inaccurate predictions on test data (which is what we care about).
# Typical values range from 100-1000, though this depends a lot on the
# learning_rate parameter discussed below.
            my_model = XGBRegressor(n_estimators=500)
            my_model.fit(X_train, y_train)

# early_stopping_rounds
# early_stopping_rounds offers a way to automatically find the ideal value for n_estimators.
# Early stopping causes the model to stop iterating when the validation score stops
# improving, even if we aren't at the hard stop for n_estimators.
# It's smart to set a high value for n_estimators and then use early_stopping_rounds
# to find the optimal time to stop iterating.
# Since random chance sometimes causes a single round where validation scores
# don't improve, you need to specify a number for how many rounds of straight
# deterioration to allow before stopping. Setting early_stopping_rounds=5 is a
# reasonable choice. In this case, we stop after 5 straight rounds of deteriorating
# validation scores.
# When using early_stopping_rounds, you also need to set aside some data for calculating
# the validation scores - this is done by setting the eval_set parameter.
            my_model = XGBRegressor(n_estimators=500)
            my_model.fit(X_train, y_train,
                         early_stopping_rounds=5,
                         eval_set=[(X_valid, y_valid)],
                         verbose=False)

# learning_rate
# Instead of getting predictions by simply adding up the predictions from each component
# model, we can multiply the predictions from each model by a small number
# (known as the learning rate) before adding them in.
# This means each tree we add to the ensemble helps us less.
# So, we can set a higher value for n_estimators without overfitting.
# If we use early stopping, the appropriate number of trees will be determined
# automatically.
# In general, a small learning rate and large number of estimators will yield more
# accurate XGBoost models, though it will also take the model longer to train since it
# does more iterations through the cycle. As default, XGBoost sets learning_rate=0.1.
                my_model = XGBRegressor(n_estimators=1000, learning_rate=0.05)
                my_model.fit(X_train, y_train,
                             early_stopping_rounds=5,
                             eval_set=[(X_valid, y_valid)],
                             verbose=False)

# n_jobs
# On larger datasets where runtime is a consideration, you can use parallelism to build
# your models faster. It's common to set the parameter n_jobs equal to the number of
# cores on your machine. On smaller datasets, this won't help.
# The resulting model won't be any better, so micro-optimizing for fitting time is
# typically nothing but a distraction. But, it's useful in large datasets where you
# would otherwise spend a long time waiting during the fit command.
