# This is a phenomenon called overfitting, where a model matches the training data
# almost perfectly, but does poorly in validation and other new data.
# When a model fails to capture important distinctions and patterns in the data,
# so it performs poorly even in training data, that is called underfitting.

# We use validation data, which isn't used in model training, to measure a candidate model's
# accuracy. This lets us try many candidate models and keep the best one.
